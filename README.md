## This Riemann sum visualizer is a website meant to be used, primarily by calculus students, as a learning gadget to help visualize Riemann sums
### Description

This visualizer webpage is capable of handling left Riemann sums, right Riemann sums, midpoint sums, and trapezoidal sums.
This calculator also always displays the entire graph at once to make visualizations comfortable.

### How to use

- First type in the function you want to graph
- Then type in the respective boundaries onto the left boundary and right boundary field
- The left boundary must have a lower value than the right boundary
- The function also must be continuos throughout the domain: (left boundary, right boundary)
- Then select the number of shapes (which will be either rectangles or trapezoids) that you want to graph
- This value refers to the n value in the approximation
- Then select which form of the Riemann sum you want to visualize
- Each selection will take place when the field is unselected/blurred
- If you want to see how the Riemann sum becomes more accurate as the n approaches infinity, press the "Go To Infinity!" button
- The area as approximated by the Riemann sum selected is displayed above the graph
